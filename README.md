# Learning Algorithms w/ CLRS
I want to be a better programmer, so I've decided to start working my way
through the canonical algorithm textbook: "Introduction to Algorithms" by
Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

While reading, I'll be taking notes (which will not be included in the repo) and
implementing every algorithm/question in the text.  The goal is to implement
everything in 5 languages: Javascript, Java, C++, Lisp, and Haskell.  Of these, 
I'm already capable in Javascript, Java, and C++, so the functional language
implementations will come a little later.

Since this exercise should build good habits, each implementation should include
proper commenting, error handling, and testing.
